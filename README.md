# Basic Weekly Dev Management Process 🚀

This is a place to document and centralise our Dev Management Process.

We're a small team of <10 devs trying to improve our efficiency.

**Top Level Rules:**
* Cards are bundled into a 2 week "Sprint"
* Production bugs can be added mid-sprint
* Meet weekly on a Tuesday to kick things off and review progress (Monday can be a little hectic)
* Meetings should have a focus on brevity
* We handle our daily standups through Slack
  * A few bullet points on: What did I do yesterday/What is my goal for today

**Our sprint board columns**

These columns currently work for our process, which includes an internal dev code review (PR) followed by external (client facing team) UAT review.

TO DO | IN PROGRESS | PR SUBMITTED | IN UAT | DONE
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---

## Sprint Kickoff Meeting (Week 1)

In this meeting we catch up, prioritise and kick of the sprint period. All as snappy and quickly as we can manage!

1. **PR's** - Run through any cards awaiting PR review and prompt the reviewer
2. **UAT** - Run through any Cards in UAT and prompt a review from the team
3. **Done** - move any cards which are complete and not yet in the *done* column
4. **On your plate 🍽️** - Go round the team, briefly updating eachother what we're working on and current bandwidth
5. **Pririties?** - Agree on high level priority projects
6. 🐜🐞🐌 - Any Bugs we should be aware of from the customer facing teams?
7. **Add cards** - Move the next bundle of cards into the new sprint section of the backlog. We currently do this individually at desks

Finally, we close out the previous sprint (any cards which are incomplete move over) and kick off the next sprint 🚀

## Mid-sprint Meeting (Week 2)

In this meeting we review progress and check in with eachother. Looking out for any blockers, prompts for reviews or major bugs to be focussed on. *(This should be a much quicker session!)*

1. **PR's** - Run through any cards awaiting PR review and prompt the reviewer
2. **UAT** - Run through any cards in UAT and prompt a review
3. 🐜🐞🐌 - Any Bugs we should be aware of from the customer facing teams?

**Ideas to improve**
* How do we painlessly add priority planning 🤔
* Retrospectives - at the end of each 2 week period spend a little time reviewing what the output was
* Task Scoring - give each card a "size" and begin to get a guage for trajctory/ better understanding of what we can fit into each 2 week bundle
